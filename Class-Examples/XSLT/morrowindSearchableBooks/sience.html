      <p>by <span class="person" id="GanpherilKimeth">Ganpheril Kimeth</span></p>
      
      <p>“I've heard of you,” said the old vagabond, very impressed. “Aren't you the adventurer
         who slew all those ash vampires in <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> a
         couple of months back?”</p>
      
      
      <p>“That I am,” said <span class="person">Oristian Silverthorn</span> with a
         weary smile for his admirer. He knew that his name was not yet legendary, and it was
         best to be polite. “And you are?”</p>
      
      
      <p>“My name would have no meaning to you, but I'm <span class="person">Erer
            Darothil</span>,” he said, raising a glass of <span class="item" id="Greef">greef</span>. “I hail from the region of <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> which is how I heard your name. Are you on an adventure as we
         speak?”</p>
      
      
      <p>“Yes,” said <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>, with a grim
         expression. “I'm challenged to rid The <span class="location">Grazelands</span> of a rogue battlemage by the name of <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>.”</p>
      
      
      <p>“I've heard of him as well,” said <span class="person">Darothil</span>. “He is
         said to be very powerful, an implacable foe.”</p>
      
      
      <p>“That is why I'm drinking now,” sighed <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>. “So tell me, what is your profession?”</p>
      
      
      <p>“I do nothing,” said <span class="person">Darothil</span> with some measure of
         pride. “But in my youth, I used to teach the skills of Illusion at the <span class="location">University of Gwylim</span>.”</p>
      
      
      <p>“Perhaps you can help me then,” said <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>, suddenly excited. “Can you teach the spell Silence? I can
         certainly pay you.”</p>
      
      
      <p>“I know that spell,” said <span class="person">Darothil</span>. “You might find
         Invisibility very helpful as well, or perhaps Darkness which would allow you to sneak
         up
         on old <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>.”</p>
      
      
      <p>“No,” said <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> firmly. “I only have
         time to learn one spell. I have to kill <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>,
         collect the award, and be back in <span class="location">Gnisis</span> as quickly as possible. My wife worries when I'm away.”</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Darothil</span> agreed and, as the two settled back in
         their seats at the cornerclub and tossed back glasses of <span class="item">greef</span>, the old man shared his knowledge of the spell. He
         explained what it truly meant to bend sound, creating a cone of silence as glass can
         bend light. He had <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> close his
         eyes while he tapped the side of his glass, making him picture the sound as the physical
         entity it was, before it was extinguished.</p>
      
      
      <p>The adventurer, after a few hours of instruction, paid the old teacher and set off
         on his
         way. <span class="location">Indoranyon</span>, <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>'s stronghold, was not far from <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>, and he soon saw the
         blight and ruin that was the battlemage's calling card. Delving into the depths of
         the
         ruins, <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> was set upon by the
         servitors of <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>, living and undead. With his
         enchanted ebony blade, he cut through legions before facing the master himself in
         the
         desolate main hall.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Egroamaro</span> bowed to his adversary sardonically, and then
         prepared to unleash a fireball to incinerate him. Before he had uttered the first
         word
         of the spell, he suddenly found that all the creaking and sighing of the ruins around
         him had been stilled. He opened his voice to speak, but there was no sound. <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> took his time, strolling across the
         length of the hall, before dispatching the battlemage with one stroke of his blade.</p>
      
      
      <p>The adventurer rushed back to the <span class="location">Tribunal Temple</span> where he had received his quest, accepted the gold and
         the thanks, and was back in his house in <span class="location">Gnisis</span> but a few days later. His wife <span class="person">Liah</span>
         was beside herself with worry.</p>
      
      
      <p>“All I could do night after night is toss and turn. I kept imagining you burned to
         ashes
         by that battlemage, and where would that leave me? Do we have enough gold that I could
         support myself if you, <span class="person">Saint Seryn</span> let it not be so,
         were killed during one of these jaunts? I don't think so. Why couldn't you get a nice
         position at the <span class="group" id="FightersGuild">Fighters Guild</span> right here in town? I
         hear they're looking for a trainer for the <span class="group">Imperial
            Guard</span>. I know, I know, you want a life of adventure and danger and freedom,
         but if you'd only take one moment to think of me, stuck here all by myself, worrying
         about you. I suppose you'd like it if I took more of an interest in your work, but
         it's
         like I was telling Ser <span class="person">Calissiah Vignum</span> the
         other day, I said <span class="person">Calissah</span>, what good is a
         husband--”</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Liah</span> continued to talk, deaf to the fact that her words were
         dead before they left her mouth. <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>
         smiled and nodded his head, enjoying the silence. He could have killed <span class="person">Egroamaro</span> without the spell, he considered, but he could
         not have survived his wife.</p>
